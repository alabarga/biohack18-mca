Playing with Mouse Cel Atlas Data at Matsue Biohackathon 2018

MCA single cell DGE data (Cells with >500UMI ) for the following manuscript:

**Mapping the Mouse Cell Atlas by Microwell-seq**

Data available at https://figshare.com/articles/MCA_DGE_Data/5435866

MCA_Figure2-batch-removed.txt.tar.gz: The batch removed dge of approximately 60,000 cells of high quality. 1500 cells were sampled from 43 tissues respectively. This sampled data is used for Figure 2.


**MCA_Figure2_Cell.info.xlsx**: The annotations of cells used in Figure2.

**tissue_uberon.json**: mapping of tissues in MCA data to UBERON

**cell_ontology.json**: mapping of cell types in MCA data to CL

**uniprot.json**: mapping of gene name to UNIPROT

**annotated_cells.csv**: mapping cell name to CL

**mca_annotated.zip (unzips to mca_annotated.csv)**: gene expression matrix filtered to genes/cells annotated
